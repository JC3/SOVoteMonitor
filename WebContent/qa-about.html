<div id="about">
	<div>This tool allows you to view the <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/290096">candidate questionnaire responses</a>
	organized by question instead of by user. It works by looking for the questions in the QA post, then parsing each user's response
	by matching text in blockquotes with the question text. The back-end polls the response every 60 seconds, you view the cached
	content; edits and changes to the posts will be updated here within 60 seconds.</div>
	<div>The styling is pretty ugly, and I'm not really a web developer. Alternate stylings or layout tips/suggestions are more than welcome.</div>
	<div>If you spot any issues or have any suggestions, please post an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/JC3/SOVoteMonitor/issues">GitHub issue page</a>.</div>
    <div class="disclaimer">Please do not share outside of SO posts (Twitter, etc.), thanks!</div>

	<ul>
	<li>Version 4
	  <ul>
	  <!-- <li>Removed "Next" and "Prev" response links again, seems counter to purpose of this tool. To browse a single candidate's entire response just visit their answer directly. -->
	  <li>Nomination posts.
	  <li>Added this about page.
	  <li>Different style on per-response "next" and "prev" links.
	  <li>Significant back-end changes to support nomination posts, and prepare to support displaying comments.
	  </ul>
	<li>Version 3
	  <ul>
	  <li>Added last edit date (if response edited) and link to revision history.
	  <li>Added "Next" and "Prev" links to each response to navigate through responses for that user.
	  <li>Removed "Show/Hide Missing Responses" toggle, it wasn't all that useful.
	  <li>Some back-end refactoring and reorganization.
	  </ul>
	<li>Version 2
